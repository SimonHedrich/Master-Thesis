## ABSTRACT

Small objects detection is a challenging task in computer vision due to its limited resolution and information. In order to solve this problem, the majority of existing methods sacrifice speed for improvement in accuracy. In this paper, we aim to detect small objects  at a fast speed, using the best  object detector Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with respect  to  accuracy-vs-speed  trade-off  as  base  architecture.  We  propose  a  multi-level  feature  fusion  method  for introducing  contextual  information  in  SSD,  in  order  to  improve  the  accuracy  for  small  objects.  In  detailed  fusion operation, we design two feature fusion modules, concatenation module and element-sum module, different in the way of adding contextual information. Experimental results show that these two fusion modules obtain higher mAP on PASCAL VOC2007 than baseline SSD by 1.6 and 1.7 points respectively, especially with 2-3 points improvement on some small objects  categories.  The  testing  speed  of  them  is  43  and  40  FPS  respectively,  superior  to  the  state  of  the  art Deconvolutional single shot detector (DSSD) by 29.4 and 26.4 FPS. Code is available at https://github.com/wnzhyee/ Feature-Fused-SSD .

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Reliably detecting small objects is a quite challenging task due to their limited resolution and information in images. Considering  this  problem,  many  existing  methods  [1-4]  have  demonstrated  considerable  improvement  brought  by exploiting the contextual information. For example, in Fig. 1, it is quite difficult to recognize the sailing boats without taking the sea into account. Besides, both the people and bike provide an evidence for the existing of the bottle and the person, which have a relationship in some extent. Another common method used for small object detection is enlarging the small regions [5] for better fitting the features of pre-trained network. Since the enlarging method would increase the computation greatly, we do not consider it.

When considering real-time detection, most of these studies are based on region-based object detection architecture, including RCNN [6], SPPnet [7], Fast RCNN [8], Faster RCNN [9], which cannot detect small objects in a fast way. The fast  detector  Single  Shot  Multibox  Detector  (SSD  [10])  presents  large  improvement  in  speed,  for  eliminating  region proposals  and the subsequent  pixel resampling  stage. To improve accuracy for small objects,  Deconvolutional  Single Shot Detector (DSSD [4]) uses the SSD architecture as baseline. Since it is concentrated on improving accuracy by using the base network residual-101 [11], it sacrifices lot of speed inevitably. Thus, for small object detection, accuracy-vsspeed trade-off is still hard to balance currently, remaining a challenging problem to be solved.

In this paper, we aim to obtain fast detection for small objects. To achieve this, we use the best object detector SSD with  respect  to  accuracy-vs-speed trade-off  as  our  base  architecture,  which  can  do real-time detection.  We propose a multi-level feature fusion method for adding contextual information in SSD baseline, in order to improve the accuracy for  small  objects.  In  detailed  fusion  operation,  we  instantiate  this  feature  fusion  method  carefully  with  two  modules, concatenation module and element-sum module. Since context may introduce useless background noises, it is not always useful for small object detection. In detail, concatenation module uses a 1 × 1 convolution layer for learning the weights of  the  fusion  of  the  target  information  and  contextual  information,  which  can  reduce  the  interference  of  useless background noises. Element-sum module uses equivalent weights set manually and fuses the multi-level features in a compulsory way, which can enhance the effectiveness of useful context. Experimental results show that our two feature fusion  modules  obtain  higher  mAP  on  PASCAL  VOC2007  than  baseline  SSD  by  1.6  and  1.7  points  respectively, especially with 2-3 points improvement on some small objects categories, such as aero, bird, boat, pot plant, TV monitor and so on. The testing speed of them is 43 and 40 FPS respectively, which is in a real-time fashion.

## 2. RELATED WORK

Context: Many  previous  studies  have  demonstrated  that  contextual  information  plays  an  important  role  in  object detection task, especially for small objects. The common method for introducing contextual information is exploiting the combined  feature  maps  within  a  ConvNet  for  prediction.  For  example,  ION  [2]  extracts  VGG16  [12]  features  from multiple layers of each region proposal using ROI pooling [8], and concatenate them as a fixed-size descriptor for final prediction. HyperNet [3], GBD-Net [13] and AC-CNN [14] also adopt a similar method that use the combined feature descriptor of each region proposal for object detection. Because the combined features come from different layers, they have different levels of abstraction of input image. So that the feature descriptors of each region proposal contain finegrained local features and contextual features. However, these methods are all based on region proposal method and pool the feature descriptors from combined feature maps, which increases the memory footprint as well as decreases the speed of detection.

Multi-scale  representation: Multi-scale  representation  has  been  proven  useful  for  many  detection  tasks.  Many previous detection architectures use single-scale representation, such as RCNN [6], Fast RCNN [8], Faster RCNN [9], and YOLO [15]. They predict confidence and localization from the features extracted by the top-most layer within a ConvNet, which increases the heavy burden of the last layer. Differently, SSD [10] uses multi-scale representation that detect objects with different scales and aspect ratios from multiple layers. With smaller object detection, SSD uses the features  from the shallower layers,  while  exploits  the  features  from the deeper  layers  for  bigger  objects  detection.  In order to further improve the accuracy of SSD, especially for small objects, DSSD adds extra deconvolution layers in the end of SSD. By integrating every prediction layer and its deconvolution layer, the contextual information is injected, which makes the predictions for small objects more accurate.

Since  the  methods  for  introducing  contextual  information  into  region-based  object  detectors  are  also  multi-scale representation, they are quite different from SSD in the way of predicting objects localization and confidence.

## 3. MULTI-LEVEL FEATURE FUSION MODULE IN SSD

We extract the multi-level  features  from  SSD  model,  which is the  state  of  the  art  object  detector  with  respect  to accuracy-vs-speed trade-off. In this section, we introduce the SSD briefly and then illustrate the two multi-level feature fusion modules in detail, which exploit the useful local context for final classification and regression.

## 3.1 Single Shot Multibox Detector

The Single shot multibox detector (SSD) is based on the VGG16 base network and ends with several newly added layers. Our model is illustrated in Fig. 2. Instead of using the last feature map of the ConvNet, SSD uses the pyramidal feature hierarchy in multiple layers within a ConvNet to predict objects with different scales. That is using shallower layers to predict smaller objects, while using deeper layers to predict bigger objects, thus it can reduce the prediction burden  of  the  whole  model.  However,  shallower  layers  often  lack  of  semantic  information  which  is  important supplement for small object detection. Therefore, passing the semantic information captured in convolutional forward computation back to the shallower layers will improve the detection performance of small objects.

Which layers to combine? We exploit the proper Conv layers to provide useful contextual information since that too large receptive field would often introduce large useless background noise. Because of SSD predicting small objects with its shallower layers, such as conv4\_3, we do not use the feature fusion module for large objects in the deeper layers for less  decrease of speed. For choosing the proper feature fusion layers, effective receptive fields in different layers are explored with deconvolution method. As shown in Fig. 3, take boats for example, the effective receptive field of the nearer  boat  within the  SSD  architecture  is  quite proper in  conv4\_3.  Conv5\_3  and  fc6  have  larger  effective  receptive fields. However, fc6, where uses dilated convolution, would introduce more background noise than conv5\_3.

Figure 3. Effective receptive fields in SSD architecture. (a) is the input image, and (b), (c), (d), (e) show the effective fields of conv3\_3, conv4\_3, conv5\_3 and fc6, respectively, shown with enhancement.

In order to inject the contextual information into the shallower layers (conv4\_3) which lacks of sematic information, we design two different modules for feature fusion, named as concatenation module and element-sum module.

## 3.2 Concatenation Module

The concatenation fusion module is shown in Fig. 4. In order to make the feature maps of conv5\_3 layer the same size as conv4\_3 layer, the conv5\_3 layer is followed by a deconvolution layer, which is initialized by bilinear upsample. Two 3 × 3 convolutional layers are used after conv4\_3 layer and conv5\_3 layer for learning the better features to fuse. Then normalization layers are following with different scales respectively, i.e. 10, 20, before concatenating them along their channel axis. The final fusion feature maps are generated by a 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension reduction as well as feature recombination.

## 3.3 Element-Sum Module

Another solution to fuse feature maps of two layers is using element-sum module. This module is illustrated in Fig. 5. It is the same as concatenation module except the fusion type. In this module, two feature maps contained different level features are  summarized point to point  with equivalent weights. In practice, this operation works well due to the two convolution layers used before, which learns features from conv4\_3 and conv5\_3 adaptively for better fusion effects. This module is inspired by DSSD [4] based on residual-101, which uses the learned deconvolution layer and elementwise operation.

Figure 4. Illustration of the concatenation module.

Figure 5. Illustration of the element-sum module.

<!-- image -->

Concatenation  module  fuses  multi-level  features  with  learning  weights  implemented  by  1 × 1  convolutional  layer, while element-sum module uses the equivalent weights set manually. With this difference, concatenation module can reduce the interference caused by useless background noises, and element-sum module can enhance the importance of the contextual information.

## 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We evaluate our feature-fused SSD model on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. In this section, the detection results of two feature fusion modules are compared with SSD and DSSD. In addition, the detection performance for small objects is shown and the comparisons are analyzed carefully. And we illustrate the testing speed of our two models in the end.

## 4.1 Experimental Setup

The feature-fused SSD is implemented based on SSD built on the Caffe [16] framework, and the VGG16 architecture, all of which are available online. The VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for the task of image classification,

(512x19x19)

is reduced of fully connected layers when used as the base network of SSD. The baseline SSD is trained with the batch size of 16, and with the input size of 300 × 300. The training process starts with the learning rate at 10 -3 for the first 80K iterations, which decreases to 10 -4 and 10 -5  at 10K and 12K.

## 4.2 PASCAL VOC2007

We train our models on the union of PASCAL VOC2007 and PASCAL VOC2012, which contain 20 categories in 9,963 and 22,531 images, respectively. Both of the two feature fusion models are fine-tuned upon the well-trained SSD baseline for another 10K iterations. The learning rate is 10 -3 for the first 60K iterations and then decreases to 10 -4 and 10 - 5 at 60K and 70K iterations respectively. All newly added layers initialized with 'xavier'.

We take several  necessary  tries  when  designing  the  most  effective  feature  fusion  modules.  Firstly,  we  explore  the proper layers to fuse with experimental results, which has been discussed in Figure 3 theoretically. As shown in Table 1, the mAP on general objects of PASCAL VOC 2007 is considerable. But we select the conv4\_3 and conv5\_3 layers to fuse, since fc6 has a larger receptive field than conv5\_3 for small objects which would introduce much more background noises.  In  addition,  we  try  different  numbers  of  kernels  when  designing  the  modules.  In  Table  2,  we  show  that  our module can work well even if the number of kernels reducing to 128, which means smaller and faster.

General  objects  detection: In  Table  3,  we  report  the  detection  performance  of  the  proposed  modules.  The  two feature-fused  SSD  methods  are  both  improved  compared  with  their  baseline  SSD  with  respect  to  general  objects detection.  The  feature-fused  SSD  with  concatenation  module  obtains  78.8  mAP,  while  78.9  mAP  with  element-sum module, which are 1.6 and 1.7 points higher than original SSD respectively. Moreover, our results are comparable with the state of the art performance DSSD 321.

Small objects detection: Since VOC2007 dataset contains 20 categories and every category may have small objects, we manually select 181 images mainly including small objects for evaluating our models better. These two methods achieve 3.6 and 2.0 mAP improvement compared with original SSD model, with respect to concatenation module and element-sum module. Detection results are shown in Fig. 6. We find that the detection performance of small objects with specific  background  improved  obviously,  such  as  small  car,  aero,  bird  and  so  on.  And  objects  which  often  appear together with relative objects are detected more accurate. For example, the people in a car as well as the bike beside a person provide supplementary evidence for the existence of each other.

Performance comparison of two fusion modules: Consider small object detection. When looking into the difference of these two feature-fused SSD methods, we analyze fusion methods and their detection results carefully. In Fig. 7, a pot plant is occluded by a desk bump, which is not the useful contextual information of it. Since the concatenation module uses learned weights to combine the target feature and the contextual feature, it can select useful contextual information and weaken the interference of the background noises. Unfortunately, element-sum model combines both target features and context in an equivalent way, thus it cannot select the useful contextual information adaptively. On the contrary, in Fig. 8, cars are blurry in the scene, so that the context is necessary for detection. In this case, element-sum module works better  than  the  concatenation  module,  because  the  latter  has  much  more  choice  that  may  not  learn  the  relationship between the target and context well.

## 4.3 Running Time

We evaluate running time for these two feature fusion methods on PASCAL  VOC 2007 test dataset, as shown in Table 4.  The detection speed of the two methods, concatenation module and element-sum module, is 40 FPS and 43 FPS respectively,  slower  than  SSD  original  model  because  of  the  extra  feature  fusion  layers.  However,  our  methods  still achieve  real-time  detection.  Compared  with  the  DSSD321  with  13.6  FPS,  faster  detection  speed  is  obtained  by  our methods,  with  comparable  accuracy  78.8  and  78.9.  Because  DSSD321  uses  Residual-101  network  as  base  network, while our methods exploit VGG16.The concatenation model uses three convolution layers with 512 kernels in each layer, and element-sum module uses two convolution layers with 384 kernels in each layer. Thus, the element-sum model is faster than the concatenation model by 3 FPS.

| DSSD321 [4]                  | Residual-101 [11] |  78.6 |  13.6 |
| Proposed concatenation model | VGG16             |  78.8 |    40 |
| Proposed element-sum model   | VGG16             |  78.9 |    43 |

## 5. CONCLUSION

We have presented a feature fusion method in SSD obtains a fast and accurate detection for small objects. Compared with the state of the art object detector for small objects, our method achieves faster detection speed, with comparable accuracy. With the two fusion operations, we have shown the advantages of them in different cases. Since context is not always  useful  information  for  small  object  detection,  which  may  introduce  useless  background  noises  sometimes, controlling the information transmission will be the further work to study.
